# MODX Accessible Manager Project

MODX Revolution has always been a stellar platform for powering accessible websites, but the back-end Manager falls short. Users that rely upon assistive devices such as screen readers, enlarged fonts and alternate input devices were left with a sub-optimal experiences when it comes to creating and managing content in the MODX Manager. 

The purpose of this project is to make MODX a first class citizen in the accessible software world, and the _premiere accessible CMS_. This will be accomplished in a way that doesn't require rebuilding your existing MODX Revolution websites, and achieves some critical goals:

* Protect existing investments in MODX Revolution sites
* Enable anyone to use MODX for managing and creating content
* Make it easy to install in an existing 2.3.x-based site by delivering it as a Manager Theme

This project is being crowdfunded, with intial seed funding sponsored by The Ohio State University. Learn more at http://a11y.modx.com/
